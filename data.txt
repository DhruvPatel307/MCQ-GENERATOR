Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models designed to create new content—such as text, images, music, or code—by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which typically focuses on recognizing patterns or making predictions, generative AI produces new outputs that mimic or innovate upon the data it was trained on.

At the core of generative AI are techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). GANs, for example, consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that work together to create realistic outputs. Meanwhile, transformer-based models, like GPT, use vast amounts of text data to generate coherent and contextually relevant content.

Generative AI has a wide range of applications, from creating art and music to generating human-like text for chatbots and virtual assistants. It's also being used in fields like drug discovery, fashion design, and game development, pushing the boundaries of creativity and automation. However, the rise of generative AI also raises ethical concerns, such as the potential for deepfakes, misinformation, and copyright infringement, highlighting the need for responsible development and use.
